# ToDo-App
I have created a To Do Web Application that allows users to type a task that they have to do and 
it will be added to the list. They would then be able to check it off by clicking the circle to the 
left which would then cross it out. They also have the option to completely delete any tasks by clicking the X 
on the right side of the task.
